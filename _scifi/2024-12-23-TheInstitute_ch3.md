## The Institute

The Institute is short for a fictional research campus known as The Institute of in situ resource utilization. Behind this boring name, this research campus focuses on cutting edge research with the specific aim of enhancing the human condition through its continuously and self-improved infrastructure. The Institute provides a sandbox for the development of human-first infrastructure and technology. Ultimately, the goal of the scientists working there is to bring the solar punk dream to reality and bring this dream beyond our own solar system.

## Blurring the lines between fiction and reality
Science fiction has often served as inspiration for many scientists and engineers. It has often shaped our approach to research with hopes to mimic the cool things we read about in sci-fi books. This space will be dedicated to highlight exciting new research and ideas through fictional narratives, situations, and characters.

The short stories presented here will cover a variety of themes including science, research, urbanism, philosophy, sociology, and the fate our species.
