ChIPanalyser is a package to predict and understand TF binding by utilizing a statistical thermodynamic model. The model incorporates 4 main factors thought to drive TF binding: Chromatin State, Binding energy, Number of bound molecules and a scaling factor modulating TF binding affinity. Taken together, ChIPanalyser produces ChIP-like profiles that closely mimic the patterns seens in real ChIP-seq data.
