Vesalius offers a wide range of tools for the analysis of spatial omics data. The original purpose of the package was to offer spatial domain identification capabilities in spatial transcriptomics data.

Since we have introduce the following functionalities:

* Multi-modal spatial domain identification
* Advanced dimensionality reduction options (PCA, UMAP, NMF, LSI, custom)
* Domain layering
* Comparison of cells across spatial domains
* Cell to cell mapping across spatial samples using multi-scale and multicontext information
* Mapping clusters
* Patient level clustering and stratification
* Improved efficieny with parallelism and C++ backend
