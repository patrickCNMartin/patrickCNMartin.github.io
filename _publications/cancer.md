Unveiling the intricate interplay of cells in their native environment lies at the heart of understanding fundamental biological processes and unraveling disease mechanisms, particularly in complex diseases like cancer. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) offers a revolutionary lens into the spatial organization of gene expression within tissues, empowering researchers to study both cell heterogeneity and microenvironments in health and disease. However, current ST technologies often face limitations in either resolution or the number of genes profiled simultaneously. Integrating ST data with complementary sources, such as single-cell transcriptomics and detailed tissue staining images, presents a powerful solution to overcome these limitations.
This review delves into the computational approaches driving the integration of spatial transcriptomics with other data types. By illuminating the key challenges and outlining the current algorithmic solutions, we aim to highlight the immense potential of these methods to revolutionize our understanding of cancer biology.
