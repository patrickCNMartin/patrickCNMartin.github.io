Welcome, Traveller!

I am a bioinformatician and data science researcher.

I aim to make the [Solar Punk Aesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqJJktxCY9U) a reality through lightweight AI models and declarative biology to produce better and cleaner biotechnology.

I started as a molecular biologist but realized that computational biology and bioinformatics was far more fun and safer.

I am what is commonly referred to as “pretty clumsy,” to the point where I would probably need my own lab safety hazard training section. To quote a friend when I once tripped and fell on a flat beach: “How on earth did you manage to survive this long?”

**My current work focuses on developing tools to understand how cells organize themselves into complex tissues, developing high fidelity synthetic data for the benchmarking of biological AI models, and developing frameworks to usher in the age of declarative biology.**


Science fiction has often served as research inspiration for me. It is a window into what we could be and what we might be able to achieve one day.  It might explain why the idea of virtual cells, distrubuted systems, solar punk futures, and planet terraforming is so appealing to me. Thank you, Kim Stanley Robinson...
